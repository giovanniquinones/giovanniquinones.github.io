In December, 2019 I went to Bolivia for vacation. I try to return every year for at least 2 weeks to visit my family. That time, I had the opportunity to bring my girlfriend with me. Never before have I felt so much like a tour guide, but it was a great experience to show her my country. 

# La Paz

We landed in the airport of El Alto. This is the highest international airport in the world at 4,100 meters above sea level (13,500 feet). The altitude can be a challenge for some people, but Helen got adapted quickly.

We went to the ancient ceremonial temple of Tihuanacu. This is a pre-Inca archeological site located 70 km from La Paz. The site is believed to be the center of the world of many cultures in the altiplano. There were a group of people celebrating a wedding in a very traditional fasion. I had no idea you could 'rent' an ancient ruin and UNESCO World Heritage site for a private wedding. Nontheless, it was a beautiful ceremony and we had the opportunity to try some traditional food involving dried potates and corn.

# Tarija

We took the bus to my hometown of Tarija. This city is located at lower altitute than La Paz, at 1,800 meters above sea level (5,900 feet), thus the weather is a lot warmer and more humid.

The central valley of Tarija is known for its wine production. Many brands of wine produced in Tarija have won international awards, specially for its Tannat and Malbec variety. We have a saying in Tarija that goes "El que vino a Tarija y no tomo vino, a que put@s vino?" which means "Whoever came to Tarija and didn't drink wine, what the f@ck did they come for?".

Lastly, we went to the Marquiri waterfalls. This is a waterfall located 30 km from the city of Tarija. These falls are almost completed enclosed in a narrow canyon, covered by a giant rock. The water sneaks through a small opening creating a surreal scene.
