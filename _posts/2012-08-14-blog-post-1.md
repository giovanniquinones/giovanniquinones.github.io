I have taken the Metrolink train about 10 times in the past 2 months out of which 3 times it was significantly delayed (90+ min delay for a 60 min trip). I also rode the LA metro which is sketchy to say the least. I shall just mention the time a gracious young woman threatened other passengers to stab them coz they expressed their discomfort of her carrying a knife.
 In California and most of the US, you can't get around unless you have a car. I read that only 5% of employed adults use public transportation, and, with my experience, I am surprise the number is even that high. 
In the US, around 30% of green house emissions come from transportation (which should result in significant percentage of the worldwide emissions). Making some basic common-sense improvements in this area is a low hanging fruit in terms of climate change action.
