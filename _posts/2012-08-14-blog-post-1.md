I have taken the Metrolink train about 10 times in the past two months, during which three trips were significantly delayed—one with a 90+ minute delay for what is typically a 60-minute trip. I also rode the LA Metro, which is, to say the least, a challenging experience. For instance, I once witnessed a young woman threaten other passengers with a knife after they expressed discomfort about her carrying it.  

In California, and much of the U.S., getting around without a car is nearly impossible. I read that only 5% of employed adults use public transportation, and based on my experience, I’m surprised the number is even that high.  

Transportation accounts for about 30% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., contributing significantly to global emissions. Addressing inefficiencies and safety issues in public transit should be seen as low-hanging fruit in the fight against climate change. Basic, common-sense improvements in this sector could have a substantial impact on reducing emissions while making public transportation a more viable and attractive option.
