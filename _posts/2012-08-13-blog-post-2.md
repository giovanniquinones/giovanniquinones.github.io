Whenever I talk to non-Bolivian people about my country, I like to mention that we have llamas. Llamas are the national animal of Bolivia and are used for their wool, meat, and as pack animals.  

Not many people know that llama antibodies are extensively used in COVID-19 research and other medical conditions. These antibodies are smaller, more stable, and highly efficient in their binding affinity.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I found it fascinating that an animal so commonly used in my country as a pack animal is now playing a critical role in the fight against diseases. It also makes me wonder how much more we have yet to learn from other animals with unique characteristics that could benefit human health.
