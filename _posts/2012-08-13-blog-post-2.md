In 2019 I visited my family in Bolivia. 
Whenever I talk to non-bolivian people about my country, I like to mention that we have llamas.
Llamas are the national animal of Bolivia and used for their wool, meat, and as pack animals.
Not many people know that their antibodies are used extensively in COVID-19 research and other conditions. These antibodies are smaller, more stable and highly efficient in their binding affinity.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I found it really interesting that an animal so extensively used in my country as a pack animal, now is determinant in the fight against diseases. It also makes me wonder about how much we are still to learn from other animals that have unique characteristics that can be used for the benefit of human health.
