As part of the B.I.G. (Bruins in Genomics) summer program, the QCBio Institute at UCLA offers undergraduate students an opportunity to engage in a highly immersive research program. Workshops were provided to train the students in advanced methods of genomics data analysis. The workshop I taught consisted of three three-hour sessions covering a comprehensive variant caller pipeline using the GATK suite of tools.
