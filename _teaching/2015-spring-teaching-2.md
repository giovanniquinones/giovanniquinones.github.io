I taught this workshop in the summer of 2020 as temporary instructor for the QCBio Collaboratory. The workshop was held online due to the pandemic. The material consists on a hand-on tutorial on the [best practices](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035535932-Germline-short-variant-discovery-SNPs-Indels) protocol from GATK for small germline variant calling.
