This workshop introduces the basic concepts and algorithms necessary to analyze single-cell RNA-sequencing data using the R package Seurat. The workshop is hands-on and covers both theoretical and computational aspects of the analysis of this type of data. Among the topics covered are:

- Quality control 
- Normalization
- Dimensionality reduction
- Clustering
- Differential expression analysis
- Pseudotime analysis
- Integration of multiple datasets

As part of the UCLA QCBio Collaboratory I teach this workshop every quarter of the academic year. If you are interested in attending the workshop register here:
