This workshop is designed to familiarize participants with the fundamental concepts and algorithms used in the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. Its primary objective is to provide attendees the skills necessary to independently conduct data analysis on their own datasets. The workshop covers the most common steps of a typical scRNA-seq data analysis pipeline, including the creation of gene count matrices, quality control, data normalization, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, cell clustering, and annotation. Throughout this workshop, we employ the Seurat package for performing these data analysis steps. Moreover, we delve into the mathematical and statistical principles underpinning these procedures, providing a comprehensive understanding and rationale for the entire pipeline.
