Bio
------
I specialize in developing computational tools for analyzing various modalities of RNA sequencing data, focusing on nucleotide variants originating from genetic and post-transcriptional processes. My primary objective is to characterize these variants and elucidate their functional implications in RNA processing within health and disease contexts.
